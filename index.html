        <p class="pt-2.5">Swiss culture is characterised by diversity, which is reflected in diverse traditional customs.
            A region may be in some ways culturally connected to the neighbouring country that shares its language,
            all rooted in western European culture. The linguistically isolated Romansh culture in Graub√ºnden in eastern
            Switzerland constitutes an exception.
            It survives only in the upper valleys of the Rhine and the Inn and strives to maintain its rare linguistic
            tradition.
            Switzerland is home to notable contributors to literature, art, architecture, music and sciences. In
            addition,
            the country attracted creatives during times of unrest or war. Some 1000 museums are found in the country.
